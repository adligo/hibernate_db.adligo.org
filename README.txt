this project give me the ability to bind Hibernate to JPA through Java.
The official non depricated way doesn't have several things I need including

runtime binding of the datasource (which I am using for JUnit testing of the connection pool)
binding to the hibernate mappings (JPA doesn't support interfaces well enough for me)
